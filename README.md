Helper keys for using powerpoint with logitech style clickers

This repository contains two scripts for use with AutoHotkey, which you can download and install by visiting [www.autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

Background
---

The start/stop key in a logitech remote alternates between Escape and f5.

The blackout key (to the right of the start/stop key) sends the OEM_PERIOD or virtualKey 0xBE (the "." key)

We trap these keys and replace them or ignore them to provide a more stable experience for the presenter.
