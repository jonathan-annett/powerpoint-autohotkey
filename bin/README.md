This folder contains pre-built versions of the scripts, which were built using AutoHotKey.

They are intended to be use on machines that don't have AutoHotKey installed, as they are standalone applications.

It's suggested that you build them yourself using the AutoHotKey compiler, as it's unlikely you'll be able to open these files on your pc without persuading Windows Defender they are ok to run.

If however you understand the risks, know how to tell Window Defender the files are ok, they are provided here.

**Patched for Microsoft® PowerPoint® for Microsoft 365 MSO (Version 2310 Build 16.0.16924.20054)**

There appears to be an issue with the above version of powerpoint, (independant of using the script) where the presenter view screen does not respond to keystrokes when alt-tabbing to it, after alt-tabbing elsewhere.

manual workaround if not using these scripts = click anywhere on the presenter view screen using the mouse

these scripts will automatically do this for you.

This version also adds a handy "find my mouse" key when in presenter view - press the / key to move the mouse to the lower right hand corner of the presenter view screen.
