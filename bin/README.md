This folder contains pre-built versions of the scripts, which were built using AutoHotKey.

They are intended to be use on machines that don't have AutoHotKey installed, as they are standalone applications.

It's suggested that you build them yourself using the AutoHotKey compiler, as it's unlikely you'll be able to open these files on your pc without persuading Windows Defender they are ok to run.

If however you understand the risks, know how to tell Window Defender the files are ok, they are provided here.
